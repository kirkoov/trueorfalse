TrueOrFalse is for adding so far of one's own 'I-didn't-know-that!' torfs (short for 'true or false statements') via a form. Torfs will get inserted in a MyISAM database under one's email, which can be used for further reference or torf removal. Multiple reads vs fewer writes and free hosting accounted for this choice of database engine.
