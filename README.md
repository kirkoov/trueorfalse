TrueOrFalse is a simple MCV web app so far for adding one's own 'I-didn't-know-that!' torfs (short for 'true or false statements') via a form. Torfs will get inserted in a MyISAM database under one's email, which can be used for further reference or torf removal (session based). Multiple reads vs fewer writes and free hosting accounted for this choice of database engine.
